How to structure dramatic questions?

Give beats an ID.

A dramatic question connects beat IDs with roles.
These roles are:
* Question
* Reminder
* Thesis
* Antithesis
* Synthesis

A dramatic question can also hold subquestions.
If a beat has neither of the above roles, it is probably either not dramatic or belongs to a subquestion.

There can be multile reminders. However a reminder is a sign that the question is either not important, that there is too much going on or that the story is not dramatic.
