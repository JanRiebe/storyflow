Future:

Load file from google drive
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/js
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/manage-downloads#downloading_a_file

- think about making scenes and sequences nested lists like in here http://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/
- think about adding multidrag

Load save and display structures.



Load, save and display dramatic questions and setup payoff.
    X research how to draw connections
    X think about design
        : table view (do this now)
            * no need for scenes
            * still draggable
            * questions as headers
            * beats as rows
            * questions ordered horizontally automatically by first beat they are in
            * cells contain text describing roll of beat in this question
            * lines connect the cells of questions that have text
        : arc view (stretch goal)
            * no needs for scenes
            * beats draggable
            * beats in one row
            * questions and answers displayed as arcs
            * only single question answer pairs
    X test whether I can drag rows in a table
        * seems like that won't work
        * grid demo is also not what I want
    X see whether I can create my own table by styling defined cell widths and using divs as rows and spans as columns
    X update connections when reordering beats
    - add questions
        X add header
        X add column
        X update width of cells when header width changes
    X encode to json
    X decode from json
    - display loaded file
        - when adding question set answer texts from beat dict
        - call the right function on load
    - update connections when editing question text
        X assign question attributes
        - redraw the connections
    - update horizontal order when editing question text
